This is the unit test suite for the [Geometrize](https://www.geometrize.co.uk/) library, a tool for geometrizing images into geometric primitives. The intent is to achieve good test coverage of the codebase, and to add regression tests for fixed bugs.

The test suite uses [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch), and is run through a CI build bot and [Coverity Scan](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/geometrize) analysis.
